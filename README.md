## Project A
### Simon - The Game

Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, with software programming by Lenny Cope, The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the series. If the user succeeds the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over. The original version was manufactured and distributed by Milton Bradley but after they went out of business, the product was taken over by Hasbro. This version of Simon expands the basic game play to have a 4 levels a player can choose from and each level provind 5 rounds.  Each round in a level is set with a new sequence with an added sequence after the first round.
